        question: "Are there any fees?",
        answer: "There are no extra fees with the KCP. You will have to pay regular Ethereum gas fees when depositing, withdrawing, or redeeming your rewards, however, you will not have to pay a gas fee for every vote."

        id: 2,
        question: "Is the KCP non-custodial?",
        answer: "Yes, when you deposit KNC into the Kyber Community Pool you are the only one who has control over your funds."

        id: 3,
        question: "Is the KCP risk free?",
        answer: "As with all DApps, nothing is 100% risk free. The smart contracts used have been audited by multiple parties to ensure better security."

    {
        id: 4,
        question: "Can the KCP steal my KNC?",
        answer: "Because the staking pool is non-custodial, this means that nobody has control over your funds at any time except you."

    {
        id: 5,
        question: "How will the pool vote?",
        answer: "The KCP puts the community first, and will continuously communicate with the community to determine their sentiment of which direction the pool should vote."
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "Will I get rewards for staking with the KCP?",
        answer: "You will receive the same rewards as you would staking individually in the KyberDAO."
